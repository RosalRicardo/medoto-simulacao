	abstract = {Cyber-physical system (CPS) is a comprehensive technical system that supports the deep integration of information and industrialization. The classical modeling and simulation method fail to satisfy the application requirements of the CPS. Therefore, a digital twin oriented dynamic data driven modeling and simulation method is proposed, and a random finite set (RFS) is used to build the data driven simulation model of physical entities and sensors of CPS. The Bayesian inference based prediction and update method is proposed to run the CPS model. The proposed method can implement the virtual and real combined simulation running for digital twin very well. It can also enable the data driven model running, and improve the accuracy and credibility of simulation results by using the data from the real space. Finally, the feasibility and validity of the proposed method is certified by using the operational application cases of the surface ships. © 2020, Editorial Office of Systems Engineering and Electronics.

	abstract = {The analysis of production systems and products during operation or usage is a key competitive factor for companies. Digital twins of products and production systems are gaining in importance here since, in addition to the analysis of operating data to estimate remaining useful life, they identify potential failure mechanisms, making it easier to locate the causes of failure. This paper outlines a concept of digital twins for predictive maintenance. The concept serves as a basis for an approach for the development of physics-based and data-driven models and their harmonization. In particular, the generation of data using a physics-based simulation model for the optimization of a data-driven model is highlighted. The concept was realized in a concrete use case for the prediction of filter clogging of a thermal regulator. The procedure is intended to support manufacturing companies in the implementation of predictive maintenance in order to optimize not only the lifetime of machines but also the next product generation. © 2021 Fraunhofer Verlag.

	abstract = {To solve the difficult problem of virtual and real fusion caused by multi-discipline, multi-physical quantity, multi-scale, dynamic time-varying and other factors in digital twin modeling, a high-fidelity modeling method of digital twin is proposed based on the operation process of contactor. The modeling method described and defined the model from three levels of geometry, mechanism and data. Based on the constructed model, the knowledge acquisition and data mapping process of the contactor's operation process were studied. Besides, to evaluate the validity of the built model, a fidelity evaluation method of the digital twin model is given. Case verification shows that the proposed digital twin high-fidelity modeling method is effective and the model can be evaluated. © 2021 IEEE},

The growing demands on the significance of digital twins result in the need for higher model depths and model scopes of the behavior models used.

This paper introduces a method, Sequential Allocation using Machine-learning Predictions as Light-weight Estimates (SAMPLE) to address this computational challenge by leveraging machine learning models trained off-line in a predictive simulation learning setting prior to a real-time decision. SAMPLE integrates machine learning predictions with data generated by real-time execution of a digital twin in a rigorous yet flexible way, and optimally guides the digital twin simulation to achieve the computational efficiency required for real-time decision-making in a CPS. Numerical experiments demonstrate the viability of SAMPLE to select optimal decisions in real-time for CPS control and operations, compared to those of using only machine learning or simulations. © Operational Research Society 2022.},
